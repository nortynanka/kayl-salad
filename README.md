## 📍About Me
👩‍💻 Hiya, I'm Kaylee. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I made this account because I did a coding bootcamp and then applied for like 300 jobs before I gave up on the ordeal, at least for now.

💡 I’m still interested in front end development, UI/UX design, and HTML/CSS. Back end stuff is really interesting to me as well, but I know less about that side. I like video game mods that fix issues game devs couldn't or won't. I want to make some of my own someday. For now I make cosmetic mods here and there.

📚 Right now I'm learning about:
- SQL
- Javascript
- Github
- German
- Psychology
- Philosophy
- Local plants, animals, geology, and conservation

🗣️ I'm into gaming, forums, wikis, reading, writing, arts and crafts, and animals. I care strongly about equal rights for everyone, true accessibility online and offline in every place, conservation and climate change, autonomy and freedom, free access to knowledge and accurate information, and nonviolence.
